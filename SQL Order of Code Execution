--SQL Training

Select *
from employees


--Not a good idea to select * from a table without a limit( Limit 100 PostgreSQL, Select Top 100 MS SQL Server)
--this can cost the company computing power or cost the company money(if its on a cloud service ))

Select student_name -- (student_name ) is a clause
Select gpa from students where student_name = 'Jennifer'; -- Expression
select * from students where age = 5 -- Predicates


--How SQL works
1. You would write your code
2. Run the code
3. SQL will actually first check if the syntax is correct


--SQL Execution Order of code

1. FROM(Tables that we need the data from)
   SQL will first identify the tables it needs to collect data from and will perform the necessarry joins
   that were specified in the script

2. Where (Condition/Clause)
 Filters rows based on the conditions next. The rows that meet the conditions specified in the WHERE clause 
 are taken into consideration

3. Group by (aggregates)
Groups the filtered rows based on specified columns.

4. HAVING(Similar to where clause)

5. Select
The relevant columns that have been mentioned in the code are now pulled. This is where the output of rows and data will be displayed

6. Distinct
Any duplicate rows are removed so we see unique results in rows

7. Order by
will sort the resukts based off of the specified columns in the script

8. Limit/Top 10 etc
Any limits that were specified are returned ie. only show 10 rows of the specfied columns


--This is useful for understanding how to optimize queries. Sometimes joins might be the bulk of your scripts run time 
--Can also be the fact that you have selected several unecessary columns or tables in the database have not been created optimally, increasing execution time

--NB Explain on PostgreSQL  will assist in optimizing your query for you (what is the query plan)
