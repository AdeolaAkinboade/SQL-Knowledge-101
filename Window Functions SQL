---Window functions
--Is an intermediate SQL skill
--useful for analyzing data


--When we say “window,” we mean a particular part of your database on which we want to apply some function. 
--The functions to use can be ranking window functions (ROW_NUMBER(), RANK(), or DENSE_RANK()), value window functions (LAG() and LEAD()),
--or MySQL aggregate window functions applied in the context of window functions, such as MAX() or MIN().

create table orders (order_id serial primary key,
                     customer_id int not null,
					 order_date date not null,
					 order_total decimal(10,2) not null
					 );

insert into orders (customer_id,order_date,order_total)
values (1, '2022-01-01','100.00'),
       (1, '2022-02-02','50.00'),
	   (1, '2022-03-01','70.00'),
	   (1, '2022-01-15','200.00'),
	   (1, '2022-02-31','150.00');

--windows function that is being used is like a counting system to keep track of the total sales for the store
--and the total sales for each customer so far(per day)

--PARTITION BY customer_id divides the data by customer_id so each customer's orders are summed separately.

--can use these window functions instead of joins sometimes for cleaner scripts
row number () over (partition by customer_id order by order_total desc = 1 
--this is also a windows functions
